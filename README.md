# Prediction_Measurement_Heterogeneity_Predictor
This code accompanies the paper "Impact of predictor measurement heterogeneity across settings on performance of prediction models: a measurement error perspective".
To reproduce the code, open the R-project and source all relevant code using the "All_RunCode.R"-file.

Files in this R project contain code for the finite sample simulations of the paper (section 5). A separate folder contains code for the large sample simulations (N = 1,000,000; presented in section 3 and 4).
